                <h4>When considering Java versus JavaScript, you’ll notice a few key
                    differences. Java is a compiled language, meaning that you write code,
                    then run it through a compiler and create bytecode. The bytecode is then run
                    in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is likely the software you have on your
                    computer. JavaScript is an interpreted language. It doesn’t get compiled but
                    is interpreted as the script runs. It's commonly used to create interactive websites.
                    You’re reading this right now on a page running JavaScript.

                                quickly became very
                                popular for creating client and server-side applications. It has a <br> similar syntax

                                Still, it is easier to understand and has fewer low-level features because that
                                functionality is
                                handled automatically by the compiler and JVM.

                                with a host of tools and educational content related to the language. Java is very
                                secure, <br> It has private methods and variables built in, so there can be no
                                unauthorized access to the <br> underlying data and functionality. Additionally, the
                                compiled app runs in a virtual machine <br> which keeps itself separate from the

                            <td>JavaScript has critical features that led to its widespread adoption. It runs live in
                                the browser without having to compile beforehand, a process called just-in-time
                                compilation. Every major web browser uses the language. It is responsible for many of
                                the interactions you see on websites, like fetching new data without reloading the page,
                                animations, checking forms for errors, chatting, posting comments, and much more.</td>

                                be created using Java, and it can even run machines. Wikipedia uses Java to execute its
                                queries when you search on their website or app, and it even controls the systems in
                                Mars rovers. Netflix, Google, Twitter, and several other big-name tech companies all use
                                Java in some form to provide their services. </td>

                                W3Techs [2]. There are over 1.98 billion websites on the internet today, according to
                                First Site Guide [3]. That’s a lot of JavaScript. It can turn a static brochure-style
                                website into a functioning application that lives in your web browser.</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>There are many reasons why Java is one of the most widely used programming languages.
                                Designed to be easy to use, Java is simpler to write and makes it easier to compile,
                                debug and learn than other languages. It’s also object-oriented, meaning you can create
                                modular programs and reusable code. One of Java’s most significant advantages is that
                                it’s platform-independent. It’s able to move easily from one computer system to another.
                            </td>
                            <td>Even though every modern browser runs JavaScript, different browsers can sometimes
                                behave a bit differently. Browsers have code that interprets the JavaScript at runtime
                                called engines. Chrome and Brave, for example, use the V8 engine, while Firefox uses the
                                SpiderMonkey engine. These engines often interpret the code in the same way, but there
                                are instances where there is different behavior than you might expect. There’s always a
                                workaround for consistent behavior and plenty of resources documenting the flaws and
                                fixing them.</td>

                            <td>Though Java touts many excellent qualities, it lacks in performance. Java tends to run
                                more slowly than languages like C and C++ and consumes a significant amount of memory.
                                That extra memory is going to require more hardware to keep things running. More
                                hardware means more money spent. Lastly, there is virtually no support for low-level
                                programming. </td>
                            <td>The ability to run in a browser is a massive advantage for JavaScript. It’s one of the
                                reasons that it has been the more popular language used in GitHub projects for several
                                years in a row. Web browsers exist on a wide array of devices. All desktop computers,
                                laptops, tablets, and smartphones have browsers, and many game consoles and smart TVs
                                also have browsers.</td>
